# Final-Budget-Calculator

Project Name: Budget calculator Team name: Mjay Team members : Michael Jackson

This project will be a budget calculator. It will be broken up into 3 categories: Needs, Wants, and Bills. you will enter what category it is, what the name of it is, and the amount. Once finished, it will display everything you entered, and the total amount everything will cost. I want to make this because i think its beneficial to college students, as most of us are on are own for the first time and its important to have a tool that will help you manage your finances.

I plan on slowly working on this project over the next couple weeks and implements more and more as we go over more concepts in class.
